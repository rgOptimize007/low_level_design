# Low Level Design Practice

- Low level design is the way of ansering "HOW" questions of a software development lifecycle.
- Here we decide what all entities their attributes and relations will form a workable model for our application.
- We represnt this design using UML diagrams.

## How to approach these questions

- Start by putting down your basic understanding about the problem statement.
- Ask questions and start listing down features this design should include.
- Try to be mindful about how complex you think , because taking too much to eat and not finishing it would just make it horrible for you.
- Ask for non functional requirements like DB requirements , How client would interact with this design (REST API's / CLI).
- If DB is part of this design then start putting down database entities , attributes and relations.
- Entities becomes classes , attributes becomes class variables and relations can be represented by Composition , Inheritance , Association.
- Write code =  * Build basic skeleton
                * Don't jump from one tab to another just to resolve errors, just complete one class and then next and then next.
                * Pick one feature which easier to build
                * Build that entire feature
                * Pick another feature and so on.

- And you are done!!

## Things to remember

- Think Simple , Not every problem needs some complex solutions.
- Don't be in a rush to solve everything in a go , pick one feature and build it completely.
